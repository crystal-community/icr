# ICR - Interactive Crystal

Interactive console for [Crystal Programming Language](http://crystal-lang.org/).

## Usage
It's like [irb](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/irb/rdoc/IRB.html) but for Crystal:

```
$ icr
icr(0.10.0) > a = 10
 => 10
icr(0.10.0) > b = 20
 => 20
icr(0.10.0) > a + b
 => 30
icr(0.10.0) > a + b + c
  undefined local variable or method 'c' (did you mean 'a'?)
  a + b + c
          ^
exit
```

## Installation

### OSX

Run: `brew install crystal-icr`

### Linux

Prerequisites:
* It requires [crystal](https://github.com/manastech/crystal) to be already installed.

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/greyblake/crystal-icr.git
```
Build
```
make
```
Copy `./bin/icr` in to direcotory that is listed in your `$PATH`, e.g.:
```
sudo cp ./bin/icr /usr/bin/icr
```
Enjoy!

## Limitations
* It is not possible to provide multiple lines in input
* It is not possible to define methods or classes.

To understand this, please read `How does it works?` section.

## How does it work?
* Every time you press `Enter` it adds new instruction, generates new crystal program and executes it.
* The output is split into 2 parts: regular program output (e.g. output from `puts 10`) and value returned by the last command
* The regular output is saved, and when you type a new instruction, new program is generated. The saved output is subtracted from the new output, and the difference is printed out. It makes an illusion that only new instructions are executed :)

## Development

To run tests:
```
make test
```
